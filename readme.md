## ✨ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Add Classes
You can create a new class with a name and description. Each class will be assigned a unique ID so you can add students to it and track their attendance later.

### 2️⃣ Add Students
After creating a class, you can add students by their name and student ID. You can assign each student to a class.

### 3️⃣ Mark Attendance
You can mark attendance for each student by selecting their status: **Present**, **Absent**, or **Excused**. All attendance records are timestamped for easy tracking. ⏰

### 4️⃣ View Attendance
A class's attendance records can be viewed with a detailed list, showing which students were present, absent, or excused on each day. 🔍
